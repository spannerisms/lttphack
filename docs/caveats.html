<h1>Caveats</h1>

<p>It's impossible to modify anything this much without sacrificing some behavior. This page details known caveats that should be taken into consideration by the user.</p>

<h2>Mosaic lag</h2>

<p>Lag from mosaics can be inaccurate, depending on what you've already done in your current play session. I'm still investigating the best way to approach this problem.</p>

<h2>Overlay corruption and the SA-1</h2>

<p>The memory layout of the SA-1 puts important hardware registers and on-board memory in an area potentially affected by overlay corruption. To prevent corruption to the SA-1, the star tile holes routine will be intercepted if it is about to write too far. This will have some effect on the timing of longer corruptions.</p>
<p>When cut short, the practice hack will continue reading without writing to see how far the writes would have gone. If they reach too far (<code>$4200</code>), then a blue screen of death will be displayed to explain the intentional lock.</p>
<p>In addition to the writing, this type of corruption may also read too far. This does not have the potential to corrupt the SA-1, but it does throw the behavior out of sync from vanilla. Normally, corruption that reaches this far is dependent on open bus behavior; however, the SA-1 places registers and memory in this region, effecting a less deterministic sea of values. To coax corruptions into resolving, a large block of memory from <code>$3680</code> to <code>$37FF</code> has been filled with the required terminator value. This solution necessarily means that far-reaching corruption may end much sooner than it normally would, making timings unreliable.</p>
